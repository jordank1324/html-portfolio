    <h1>Heres's a little bit about me!</h1>
    <p> My name is Jordan Kenny and I'm a 23 year old learning all about web development, trying to obtain the skills necessary
        to become a full stack web developer. I intend to use these skills to earn some money as a side job. I am currently working as an engineer 
        within the semiconductor industry, working with a company who produces the tools and equipment used by chip makers during the manufacturing process.
        I work on tools such as CVD, PVD and ALD systems.
    </p>
    <p> I have a strong background in physics and chemistry, with a bachelors and masters degree in nanoscience and nanotechnology, respectively.
        I enjoy coding and have good experience in writing code with Python. I have used this extensively throughout university but now its time to learn 
        some more coding languages!
    </p>
    <p> I enjoy reading books, learning to code and astronomy. If the sky is clear at night, I usually always have at least one telescope set up to 
        view the night sky!
