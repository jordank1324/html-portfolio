# html-portfolio
My first html portfolio documenting my progree in learning html.

I am currently undertaking an online course in full-stack webdevelopment. THe projects that can be seen in my portfolio are mini-projects I have done during the course so far whilst learning about HTML.
Soon I will be learing about CSS and Javascript and will be able to further improve my current html portfolio into something a little bit more creative!
